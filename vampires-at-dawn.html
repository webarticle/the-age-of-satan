    <div class="section">

        <div class="row">
            <article class="col s12 center">

                <p class="left-align light">I wake up. Still dark outside. It wasn’t not the alarm clock that woke me
                    up. It was some voice inside me whispering: "DANGER... DANGER..." I look around the room
                    apprehensively, the blood in my veins running icy cold. Perhaps some maniac has sneaked into the
                    house and my instinct shook me up. But everything seems to be all right. The street lamp outside my
                    window is off and I can’t see very well, but also I don’t feel any presence. I look at the clock.
                    Twenty past five. Damn! I could have slept another hour, at least. Now I have to leave my bed in the
                    dark. That stupid feeling of sneaking danger!</p>

                <p class="left-align light">The darkness begins to dissolve. The sun will soon rise above the horizon.
                    My cat, Clara, jumps onto the bed and snuggles beside me, purring. How sweet she is! But, instead of
                    leaving me alone, the terrible premonition strengthens its grip. I look around and the horror
                    benumbs my body. Clara feels my nervousness and lifts her head. I look into her bottomless green
                    eyes and it’s as if I am drowning into them. But these eyes are definitely not a pleasant, or
                    comfortable place to be. This is the abyss of horror, blind horror, of panic, of deadly fright.
                    Suddenly I realize: I woke up because I was horrified of my cat. If the sun was shining, if the
                    situation was different, I would have laughed the whole idea off. But I am here, now, and the
                    dread’s icy fingers are reaching for my heart. I want to hug my kitty, but some voice whispers to
                    me, warning: if I do, Clara would jump up to my face and scratch my eyes out. I’d see nothing but
                    complete darkness, I’d only feel the sharp claws tearing at the skin of my face. Then the pain would
                    move down, towards my breasts, my stomach. She would tear me apart as she would a mouse. She would
                    bite and scratch, bite and scratch, she wouldn’t stop before she makes of me a pile of dead meat
                    pieces. The dread overtakes my consciousness and I look, my eyes wide open, to see whether the cat
                    is getting ready for her jump.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">If somebody entered the room at that moment they would wonder why I am
                    staring like this at the nice little kitty with the emerald green eyes, purring softly beside my
                    legs. I wouldn’t be able to explain. We were friends only yesterday, Clara and I, and this morning I
                    feel about her as if she is my mortal enemy. Perhaps she is.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">The day breaks outside. The first sun rays already pierce the sky above the
                    horizon. A shiny sunspot falls on Clara’s face. Green flames play in her eyes. They turn from green
                    to yellow, to blood-red. "Vampire," that’s my first thought. The cat moves closer. Her now red eyes
                    sparkle, bloodthirsty. I dare not move or breathe. Clara simply snuggles, pressed to my body, ready
                    to fall asleep in the hollow between my shoulder and my head. In that moment I forget what I was
                    thinking up until then. Something bothered me and woke me up - just that, all else is nothing, a
                    figment of my imagination. Clara embraces my neck with her soft paw, I close my eyes and try to
                    sleep.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">It feels like an syringe needle in my neck. The pain though isn’t so bad, so
                    perhaps I am imagining once more? No. Not this time. I feel something penetrates my skin, my flesh,
                    sucks my blood. I slowly open my eyes. The cat has bitten into my neck. Her blood-red eyes are
                    friendly, watching me. I feel my blood flowing into her. I feel sleepy. So she is a vampire, after
                    all, I am thinking. And it’s not so bad, to be bitten by one. It even feels pleasant. Something odd
                    is happening to me. I’m no longer "I". Now I am a part of Clara. Now I know. Now I can remember.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">Oh, thank you, Clara! You gave me eternal life. Only few, elect people can
                    live after death. The rest of them simply disappear as if they never existed, like an extinguished
                    flame of a candle. There are many tales and stories about vampires, because people have no idea what
                    they really are. It’s very simple, indeed: a vampire is the savior of the few selected to live
                    forever. And some people assume that it is bats that suck out the blood of the saved, because the
                    marks a bat leaves are very similar to ours. I realized, too, how I went over into the cat’s body.
                    Blood is the soul of a human being. When you lose blood, you feel sick, because you actually lose a
                    part of your soul. The blood regenerates, but only to a limit. If, as in my case, somebody sucks up
                    most of the blood of a friend, they become a single being.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">There are few remaining vampires nowadays. Now I am one of them. Indeed, I
                    have the feeling that Clara has saved many people and now we are a single "I", all of us.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">Well, now I should be on my way to find new friends worthy of eternal life.
                    And... who knows, maybe you are one of them?</p>
