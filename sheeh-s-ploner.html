            <article class="col s12 center">

                <p class="left-align light">Sheeh moved two of her antennae to attract the attention of her She-parent.
                    The latter turned to her and flashed back angrily. The child apologized according to custom and
                    flashed again. She wanted to own a ploner. The She-parent flashed too, this time proudly. It was
                    better than she had expected, the young one would have her own way and this was good for her age.
                    Very well, she could have what she wanted... The She-parent promised the gift and sent her daughter
                    packing to the vivacity garden.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">Sheeh could not resist the temptation and told her girlfriends that she
                    would have a ploner when she came back home tonight. Some of the girls got awful envious and turned
                    their back on Sheeh. Sheeh’s best friend Leeh was among them. All day long they would flash
                    mockingly and wave their antennae whenever Sheeh would go near any of them. But they did not succeed
                    in spoiling the child’s happiness. She kept flashing and flashing impatiently until eventually the
                    vivacity garden nannies got cross and made her put her lights out.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">Barley waiting for the fourth sun to set, Sheeh ran home. The day had seemed
                    incredibly long to her. In the house, Sheeh wove three of her antennae around the door of the
                    tasting-room, where the ploner was supposed to wait for her.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">She saw him upon entering, standing on the table with the She-parent holding
                    him tightly to prevent him from escaping. He was so cute, with his soft rosy skin and ridiculous
                    four extremes! And his sweet little face! Those creatures had very little sensory organs, just a
                    nose and a mouth, in addition to two eyes. And no antennae, none at all! The ploners were cuddly and
                    made good house pets provided they got used to you. In time some of them even began to understand
                    what you wanted to flash to them... Sheeh began to listen to the strange sounds coming from the
                    little animal. The ploner was bubbling something like ‘Whassthis here? Who mayou be? Leavemelone,
                    pls!’ She flashed him a friendly message to calm him down. The little ploner was quite small, he
                    could not even get to her first knee, and looked fragile. Sheeh embraced him with two of her
                    antennae although he was obviously displeased and was trying to get away from her. After a while the
                    ploner succumbed to her embrace and made a sound, which was certainly an expression of pleasure.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">She was to hear this sound repeatedly in the future, and was to be glad she
                    had been able to make the ploner happy.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">The sound deciphered into something like ‘HELP!!!’.</p>
