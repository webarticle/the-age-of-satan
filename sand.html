                <p class="left-align light">The beach was terrific! Quiet and secluded, not a living soul in sight.
                    Bobby looked around, smiling. Exactly what he needed! A quiet place to get some rest. Most men could
                    only envy the way he influenced women, but he thought it was rather boring. Really awful to have all
                    these crowds of empty-headed beauties, barely dressed mostly, hanging around you, making it
                    impossible for you to go anywhere alone. He wished there was something, anything reasonable to talk
                    about with them, anything that made any sense, but... Of course he had also seen some wonderful
                    girls, but these were the exceptions from the rule. And, when he came across somebody he thought
                    acceptable to have a lasting relation with, it always turned out they had a boyfriend or a husband.
                    Well, he had slept with almost all the girls in town, but... He, too, wished he could find a woman
                    to live with for a time, or even one he could marry - although the idea did not appeal to him that
                    much. All he wanted was a girl who understood him. He was sick of all these looks which seemed to be
                    saying: "What’s he like in bed? He has slept with all the girls around. Why not me? And everybody
                    says he’s terrific." And the nonsensical: "Well, that’s what I thought, too," coupled with an
                    inviting smile. He did not fall for women who would offer themselves. He would rather win them with
                    some effort. He wanted to appeal to them with something different than this Casanova stuff. Worst of
                    all, he had no way whatsoever to get rid of the girls who hung around him all the time. Everywhere.
                    A girl once even got into his hotel room to set a surprise for him in sexy underwear. Well, he could
                    not deny he liked it.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">He knew why they liked him so much. His long golden hair was something any
                    girl dreamed of, his eyes, greenish-blue, also seemed to influence them and, in addition, there was
                    his great body - suntanned and weathered because he surfed almost all the time. He adored that
                    sport! And it was welcome for his admirers. When he was riding on the board all the girls on the
                    beach stared at him as if nothing else existed around. Many times they told him how they loved to
                    watch him riding the waves, how masculine he was, how, his muscles tensed, he looked like a panther
                    ready to jump while waiting to catch a wave and keep going for as long as he could. Well, they
                    compared him to many things but he liked most the panther simile. Indeed, the feeling one got when
                    on the board, the sense of the wave power underneath was something that defied description. One had
                    to experience it, live through it! He had no idea what he looked like to the onlookers, but there,
                    on the water, he felt like a god, totally in control, although he knew how easy it was to slip, to
                    balance your body the wrong way in the wrong moment, and lose your life to the roaring power of the
                    ocean which seemed as if waiting for it. But Bobby was not afraid. He was precise in his movement
                    and his expertise was something a lot of the surfers admired. And the girls, of course.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">Now he looked around satisfied. The place was simply wonderful. He had
                    managed to get rid of the latest crowd of dumb chicks - he just mounted his bike and roared down the
                    road along the beach. He rarely did that - he had qualms because the fact that women liked him could
                    not be any good reason to hate them, but today he simply could not stand it anymore. He had had
                    enough. He was glad he found this secluded beach. It was surrounded by jagged cliffs, so he doubted
                    anybody had ever come down here before. The only reason he found it was the strong wind which took
                    up his T-shirt and blew it over here while he was settling down to the adjacent, rather unpleasant
                    strip of beach, where there were some couples and one or two loners like himself. There was also a
                    girl, definitely under twenty, who smiled invitingly the moment she saw him dismounting his bike.
                    Then he thought of moving further south, but he knew he’d find even more people there - it was
                    pointless. At least he thought so until he came across this paradise of a beach. The sand was very
                    fine, not so hot now. Only its color poked at his consciousness, reminding him of something he
                    failed to identify. He did not like this sickly yellowish, nothing-definite of a color, but what the
                    hell - the shells here once were like this, and the sand they produced had such a disgusting
                    coloring.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">It was between five-thirty and six, the heat of the day had gone. The first
                    thing he was aware of, when he stepped on the sand, was that here he did not feel the wind. Probably
                    because of the cliffs around. The sand-covered space among them was rather small, no more than fifty
                    feet. Nobody would bother him here. He lied on the pleasantly warm sand and closed his eyes. He had
                    been dreaming of this for such a long time! Some rest without the neverending blather of the
                    empty-heads around. Now he could enjoy it in full.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">He had no idea for how long he would remain like this. He had no idea
                    whether he hadn’t dozed off at some time. And the sun wasn’t scorching - now you could lie in the
                    pleasant warmth without this burning heat. When he finally decided it was time to go, the sun was
                    about to set. He stood up. His shadow was long, reaching almost to the cliffs that hid the beach
                    from the road. There was something odd about the shadow, however. Bobby looked at it closely. He
                    moved one hand, then the other. The shadow moved, too, but... It seemed to him that it moved
                    somewhat slower. He smiled. What a wild fantasy! They often poked fun at him because of it and of
                    late he was reluctant to voice even the simplest ideas that came to his mind: the sleeping bird
                    camouflaged as his best friend’s wardrobe, waiting for the right moment to flap its wings and fly
                    away; the nice extraterrestrial creature hiding in his parent’s larder, who would never show up, if
                    somebody might see it (Bobby knew it was there all the same); the strange creature of unknown origin
                    his sister ignorantly took for a tablecloth - it was of so many colors and patterns, its very
                    history was woven into it, and his poor sister thought it was just a rather unsightly tablecloth
                    with so many odd, meaningless drawings. He was aware he could not rely on his subconsciousness - it
                    always generated newer illusions. He had learned to ignore it and to avoid talking about it to his
                    friends, because they would definitely think he was going off his mind, but when he was alone, as he
                    was now, he could afford a little indulgence. He waved his hands wildly, and laughed when the shadow
                    repeated the movement. Then his laughter dried up. His hands were now hanging beside his body, and
                    the shadow moved its left hand. It was just a twitch really, but he was positive he saw it. Suddenly
                    the fear overwhelmed him. Come on! His imagination had never played such tricks on him. He could
                    distinguish between fantasy and reality, and the twitch he saw was quite real. He froze in his steps
                    and waited for something else to happen. Only the quite splashing of the waves behind his back was
                    heard in the silence. Bobby wondered what was wrong. Yes. It was the silence - he couldn’t hear any
                    traffic on the road, there were no bird cries. Nothing but the level hum he had been listening to
                    all his life. Normally this would comfort him, but not now. He suddenly wanted it to stop. It felt
                    like something the ocean whispered, in an unknown language, to somebody he couldn’t see... Maybe to
                    his own disobedient shadow, advising it what to do, how to detach itself from him and live a life of
                    its own. It was with him for much too long, gliding over the waves while he was surfing... Now it’s
                    time to do whatever it wanted, enough of him deciding where it should go and what it should do. He
                    shuddered. What would he do without a shadow? Odd... Not that he needed it, but somehow it was a
                    part of him, he could not imagine what it would be like if it wasn’t there. And, they would
                    certainly lock him up somewhere and interrogate him, they would try to find out how it happened,
                    this phenomenon might be reproduced... Not because there might be any use of that, but because human
                    mind would always be tempted by the unknown, the unseen, the impossible.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">The shadow moved again. It lifted its right hand - now he saw it as a
                    separate creature - and, it seemed to him, looked at it up and down with its featureless face. He
                    stared and wondered what would happen if he suddenly ran away - would the shadow follow him? Or
                    would it prefer to stay here on this wonderful beach, free at last? He decided to try. He lifted one
                    leg, slowly. The shadow quickly drew up its ghostly limb and stretched it almost to the far end of
                    the beach as if testing its capabilities. Bobby stepped on the sand and realized that the only thing
                    that now linked him to the creature so suddenly alive, was his other leg. He lifted that, too, and
                    the shadow slipped away, without a trace of hesitation. It slid by his side, then up and down the
                    sand, but did not go further than that, did not go over the cliffs to disappear God knows where.
                    Something still kept it here. It changed its size a few times, from a small, noon-time shadow, to a
                    monster of a shadow which one cannot see even at sunset.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">Bobby wondered at his own self-control. He knew how most people would react:
                    "Oh my! This is absolutely impossible!!! I can’t believe it! I must be hallucinating! It can’t be
                    anything else. Or dreaming. Yes, it’s one of the two. In fact, this isn’t happening and I’ll wake up
                    in bed shortly and tell everybody what a crazy dream I’ve had. Shadows with lives of their own! Ha!
                    What an insanity! Absolutely impossible!" But most people, of course, did not have his imagination.
                    They lost that together with their childhood, long, long ago. He pinched himself just in case,
                    although he knew in advance what the result would be. He felt the pain. And most certainly failed to
                    make the roaming shadow disappear or, at least, come back and behave properly. Obviously, however,
                    it had had enough and now hung in front of him in its normal, slightly elongated by the sunset
                    shape. It seemed to be peering at him, wondering: "What am I to do with you now, eh? What do I need
                    you for? Twenty two whole years you’ve been making me do things quite different from what I’ve
                    always wanted to do. You think I liked all that surfing? Hell, I hate the ocean! Or going to bed
                    with all those girls? I could have used the time you wasted in such a way for much better purposes!"
                    But in spite of the transformation, the creature could not - would not, Bobby corrected himself -
                    speak.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">The two of them stared at each other silently, and after awhile Bobby looked
                    away. He didn’t like the aura of the creature. Then he turned his eyes back down and almost jumped
                    with surprise. For the fraction of the moment he was looking away, the shadow had extended to cover
                    the whole beach, as if there was something huge hanging over, casting such an enormous shadow.
                    Almost against his will Bobby looked up, just in case there was something there. Of course there was
                    nothing. Then, again, he looked down at the sand. He thought he had already seen enough, but he was
                    wrong. The shadow began to sink. It paled, as happens in low light and then it seemed to soak into
                    the sand. In a few seconds it seemed as if nothing at all had happened under the last sun-rays. If
                    he didn’t look down to see that there was nothing there, no shadow at all, he might have though it
                    was a dream. But he looked and there was no shadow, and he was sure it was real. He shook his head
                    deep in thought. Well, he had to go, shadow or not. He started for the cliffs, to climb back up the
                    path he had descended by. Only a couple of steps later the ground shook slightly under his feet and
                    he knew there was more waiting for him. He stood by the cliff-face and waited. Another quake, this
                    time strong enough to pull him down. Somehow he managed to remain erect. Now the grains of sand
                    vibrated madly. A small whirlwind formed, like a miniature sand storm between the rocks. And it felt
                    like a sand storm, with the grit pricking and penetrating everywhere - in his hair, between his
                    teeth, although he kept his mouth firmly closed, in his eyes and ears, everywhere. And it gained in
                    strength, instead of subsiding. The sand began to scratch his skin really painfully, he thought he
                    saw some blood on his hand when he lifted it to protect his eyes. Something made him open his eyes,
                    just the tiniest slits, enough for him to have a look at the beach he thought wonderful until very
                    recently. Now it was like something out of the darkest corners of his wild imagination. And he saw
                    what his former shadow had turned into - something enormous, shapeless emerged from the whirlwind,
                    sucking in all the sand. In fact this was the sand, suddenly alive. And this huge monster stretched
                    out one limb, which the cloud of sand dutifully formed, controlled by somebody else’s will, and
                    caught Bobby around his waist. The flying grains of sand were certainly hurting, but at least they
                    were something you could live with - a couple of scratches here and there and nothing more. Now,
                    however, the sand monster drew him into its core, where all this sand was spinning wildly,
                    destroying everything in its way - no matter was it pebbles ground into powder, or was it flesh
                    removed from the bones of a living, screaming, fighting for his life human being. Bobby felt
                    millions of grains tearing his flesh apart, annihilating his body, destroying perfectly any evidence
                    of his very existence. Some seconds later what was left of him was unrecognizable. But he was still
                    alive. It was inconceivable for him to feel such a pain and be alive. All talk about hell now seemed
                    an appealing alternative and he would pay anything to be there instead of in the middle of this sand
                    storm by the ocean. The grains of no definite color continued to rip pieces of his body and disperse
                    them all around. Bobby had covered his eyes with his hands - or rather, with what had remained of
                    them, when something heavier bumped into his cheek. He opened, for a fraction of a second, his still
                    functioning right eye and saw something he wished he hadn’t seen - it was his right ear, ripped off
                    its place. The moment he saw it, it disintegrated under the relentless attacks of the sand. Then he
                    looked down and found himself flying above the ground, saw that almost nothing had remained of his
                    body. Then he lost a leg, a hand, the other leg. When he saw the remnants of his limbs, the bloody
                    peaces of flesh, the severed tendons, the gristle of his knee, the ripped muscles and the bones
                    protruding out of them, he finally remembered what the sand reminded him of. A moment later the sand
                    finished off with his remaining eye, and never stopped until nothing was left of him, but the fine
                    powder of his bones, which could not be ground any further. Then the whirlwind suddenly stopped. As
                    if God had commanded: "Enough of that! No more!" The particles of sand stopped their motion and just
                    hung in the air until they settled onto the small beach. Nobody would guess that now there was a
                    handful of sand more than yesterday. And, in fact, nobody could come to this place more than once.
                    The secret had to be guarded.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">The ocean continued relentlessly, indifferently, impartially to wash the
                    beach. It wasn’t for the first time to witness this - after all, there were only rocks before the
                    first one ever came. Besides, Bobby liked to dominate over the ocean, to ride the waves, while the
                    watery plain certainly disliked people like him. Let it feed on them. As far as it did not touch the
                    creatures of the sea. There were so many people, a hundred or so more or less were of no
                    consequence.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">Mira stood up. Her neck was strained from looking at the direction where the
                    guy with the bike disappeared. She had been waiting for him to come back since six o’clock, when he
                    headed for the cliffs. She still hoped she had a chance with him. But it was nine already and she
                    could not spend the night here, on the beach. She would try to find him. After a rather tiring climb
                    up the forbidding rocks, and a couple of scratches and bruises later, she found the place he
                    probably went to. Now it was empty. He’d gone. Perhaps he wanted to avoid her. She was angry.
                    Wasting the whole of three hours waiting for a guy and he disappears like that. What a luck! She did
                    not go down - she could see that was pointless. She tried to calm down. After all, if it wasn’t for
                    him, she would never find this nice secluded place. No one in his right mind would try to climb
                    these disgusting rocks just for the sake of it. Well, she might come back tomorrow. If he came here
                    regularly, she’d be waiting for him. Everything seemed perfect about this place, except... The color
                    of the sand bothered her. She had never seen anything like that before. It reminded her of
                    something. What was it? Of course... it reminded her of dried human bones, left for quite a long
                    time in the open air.</p>
