                <p class="left-align light">The beach was terrific! Quiet and secluded, not a living soul in sight.
                    Bobby looked around, smiling. Exactly what he needed! A quiet place to get some rest. Most men could
                    only envy the way he influenced women, but he thought it was rather boring. Really awful to have all
                    these crowds of empty-headed beauties, barely dressed mostly, hanging around you, making it
                    impossible for you to go anywhere alone. He wished there was something, anything reasonable to talk
                    about with them, anything that made any sense, but... Of course he had also seen some wonderful
                    girls, but these were the exceptions from the rule. And, when he came across somebody he thought
                    acceptable to have a lasting relation with, it always turned out they had a boyfriend or a husband.
                    Well, he had slept with almost all the girls in town, but... He, too, wished he could find a woman
                    to live with for a time, or even one he could marry - although the idea did not appeal to him that
                    much. All he wanted was a girl who understood him. He was sick of all these looks which seemed to be
                    saying: "What’s he like in bed? He has slept with all the girls around. Why not me? And everybody
                    says he’s terrific." And the nonsensical: "Well, that’s what I thought, too," coupled with an
                    inviting smile. He did not fall for women who would offer themselves. He would rather win them with
                    some effort. He wanted to appeal to them with something different than this Casanova stuff. Worst of
                    all, he had no way whatsoever to get rid of the girls who hung around him all the time. Everywhere.
                    A girl once even got into his hotel room to set a surprise for him in sexy underwear. Well, he could
                    not deny he liked it. <a href="sand.html">Read the full story</a></p>

                <p class="left-align light">From the guide’s speech in the Museum of Archaeology:</p>

                <p class="left-align light">"And this, ladies and gentlemen, is the biggest mystery of all times. This
                    object here was found only recently, some ten years ago. It looks like a wristwatch, but actually it
                    is a message left for us. If you look closely, you’ll see the rough back surface. This is actually
                    writing, in contemporary world language, which can be read only under microscope. Here’s the
                    message:</p>

                <p class="left-align light">‘Beware of the power contained in this device. The Evil of our planet is
                    locked within. We know that you’ll be reasonable enough as a race (even though you’ll be so
                    different from us) and this is why we entrust to you with the role of Guardians of the Evil. The
                    Evil should be guarded with utmost care. If somebody puts this watch on his wrist, the Evil shall be
                    free and the Age of Satan will set in. Should you allow this to happen, your only chance shall be
                    the liquid in the small bottle you will find together with the device. The Evil should be sprinkled
                    with it while it’s second day at large has not run out or you’ll never be able to deal with it.
                    Humankind shall be erased from Earth.’ <a href="the-age-of-satan.html">Read the full story</a></p>

                <p class="left-align light">I wake up. Still dark outside. It wasn’t not the alarm clock that woke me
                    up. It was some voice inside me whispering: "DANGER... DANGER..." I look around the room
                    apprehensively, the blood in my veins running icy cold. Perhaps some maniac has sneaked into the
                    house and my instinct shook me up. But everything seems to be all right. The street lamp outside my
                    window is off and I can’t see very well, but also I don’t feel any presence. I look at the clock.
                    Twenty past five. Damn! I could have slept another hour, at least. Now I have to leave my bed in the
                    dark. That stupid feeling of sneaking danger! <a href="vampires-at-dawn.html">Read the full story</a></p>

                <p class="left-align light">Ayona was born in the Female Half of the Kingdom. Women were ruling there,
                    they struggled to keep their land and took decisions. Men were their slaves and had no rights
                    whatsoever. The reverse situation was in the Male Half. Sometimes it just happened that a male, or a
                    female, slave escaped to the other Half but neither could get used to, let alone fight with, the
                    specific types of crime raging in the respective other Half, and soon died of hunger or with a slit
                    throat.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">The Kingdom had been divided into those two Halves from time immemorial. Two
                    territories constantly at enmity one with another. Women kept the Crystal Sword. The legend had it
                    that Tavinga had used it to separate Earth from Heaven. Tavinga was the Kingdom’s Chief Goddess. The
                    Sword belonged to the Criyu Royal family. In the other Half, Men had their Bronze Axe. There was
                    another legend to explain that Ritoh, their Chief God, had used the Axe to mark the Border between
                    the Halves, a dark endless void of which horror stories circulated. <a href="the-eye-of-the-salyun.html">Read the full story</a></p>

                    The latter turned to her and flashed back angrily. The child apologized according to custom and
                    flashed again. She wanted to own a ploner. The She-parent flashed too, this time proudly. It was
                    better than she had expected, the young one would have her own way and this was good for her age.
                    Very well, she could have what she wanted... The She-parent promised the gift and sent her daughter
                    packing to the vivacity garden. <a href="sheeh-s-ploner.html">Read the full story</a></p>
