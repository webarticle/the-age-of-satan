                <p class="left-align light">Ayona was born in the Female Half of the Kingdom. Women were ruling there,
                    they struggled to keep their land and took decisions. Men were their slaves and had no rights
                    whatsoever. The reverse situation was in the Male Half. Sometimes it just happened that a male, or a
                    female, slave escaped to the other Half but neither could get used to, let alone fight with, the
                    specific types of crime raging in the respective other Half, and soon died of hunger or with a slit
                    throat.

                <p class="left-align light">The Kingdom had been divided into those two Halves from time immemorial. Two
                    territories constantly at enmity one with another. Women kept the Crystal Sword. The legend had it
                    that Tavinga had used it to separate Earth from Heaven. Tavinga was the Kingdom’s Chief Goddess. The
                    Sword belonged to the Criyu Royal family. In the other Half, Men had their Bronze Axe. There was
                    another legend to explain that Ritoh, their Chief God, had used the Axe to mark the Border between
                    the Halves, a dark endless void of which horror stories circulated.

                <p class="left-align light">Ayona Criyu was sent to grow up on the city’s outskirts where female beggars
                    loomed at every corner ready to cut throats to steal as small a thing as a silver ring. This was a
                    place where one learned how valuable human life was. The young girl was left to grow up wild and
                    unruly. There had been this special thing about her: ever since her very first day in the Royal
                    bedroom to her seventeenth birthday of a couple of weeks ago, she had been taught that she was the
                    Chosen One. There was an open-mouth statue in each of the Halves, one of Tavinga in the Female Half,
                    and one of Ritoh in the Male Half. They were in fact small, yet very potent volcanoes, capable of
                    annihilating their respective Halves. To save the population from perishing, Gods had sent them the
                    Eye of the Salyun, a fist-size precious stone of a fiery yellow. When put in the mouth of one of the
                    statues, it extinguished the volcano and the danger was avoided. But the stone was only one while
                    the statues were two. The stone would remain in the mouth of one of the statues for ten years and
                    all would be peace and calm until the second volcano was activated. Then the population in danger
                    would send a Chosen One to the other Half to steal the stone and save themselves. In another ten
                    years the reverse would happen. The Chosen Ones had to belong to the Criyu family since they owned
                    the Crystal Sword and the Bronze Axe and they alone could touch the Eye of the Salyun without
                    turning into dust.

                <p class="left-align light">Ayona often went to the Palace, to be taught how to handle the ancient
                    weapon. The Sword was very heavy and one could hardly handle it for two minutes without prior
                    training. However, Ayona was strong and tenacious and was capable of brandishing it for hours on
                    end, without even a trace of fatigue. After the training sessions Ayona was free to go wherever she
                    liked. She preferred the nondescript bars where the most dangerous women gathered from all over the
                    place. Ayona was on friendly terms with most of them, and felt sisterly to Kitasha the Thief. Ayona
                    had already decided to include Kitasha in the dangerous mission she was about to undertake. No one
                    could understand what was there to make these girls like one another so much. Despite being six foot
                    Ayona seemed small next to her friend who was six foot ten. Ayona’s hair was short and brown and her
                    eyes were olive green while Kitasha had long blond hair braided or just pony-tailed, and very dark
                    brown eyes. In addition, she was as sly as a fox, and just as cruel, and could spread lies all day
                    long without batting an eyelid. The Princess and the Thief spent most of their time together. They
                    would wait in some dark alley for someone to pass, and would rob her. They did not own any slaves,
                    because they were street girls. Often, they would spend the night with another female friend
                    entertaining foreign men.

                <p class="left-align light">The day came when the Princess was already an excellently trained thief, so
                    deft, in fact, that she could steal money from any woman’s hand without being noticed. She was just
                    wondering what to take up next when she saw her teacher, Sanaya.

                <p class="left-align light">"I am here, Sanaya. What’s the matter, isn’t it too early for the training
                    session?"

                <p class="left-align light">"The time has come, my girl. You should go. The Volcano is active. If you do
                    not come back in five days, there would be nowhere to come back to."

                <p class="left-align light">Sanaya sounded as though Ayona and the Half were doomed.

                <p class="left-align light">"So what’s your problem? You do not believe me ready, do you? Very well,
                    I’ll show you. Come, Kitasha, let’s go."

                <p class="left-align light">The Princess was furious. She took her friend by the hand and walked to the
                    Palace fuming.

                <p class="left-align light">"Ayona, wait! Take this." The teacher put two small grains in her hand. "You
                    do not seem to remember that you have to cross the Border. This will help."

                <p class="left-align light">"Thanks," said the girl, already regretting her outburst.

                <p class="left-align light">She took again her friend’s hand and they continued their way to the Palace,
                    although more calmly.

                <p class="left-align light">"Good luck!" the teacher whispered after them.

                <p class="left-align light">The two girls took the Crystal Sword from the Palace and embarked upon the
                    road. On the first day they had to reach the void, and cross it during the night, on the next day
                    they were supposed to reach Sinru where the Eye of the Salyun was, take it at night, and return. If
                    nothing went wrong, they could be back home a day before the fatal deadline.

                <p class="left-align light">Nothing exciting happened on the first day. As they had not taken any food,
                    they had to kill a salyun for their lunch. The precious stone was called after the salyuns because
                    of their eyes which resembled gems. The salyuns were small furry brown-and-yellow cuddly animals.
                    Some people even took them as home pets, they were so sweet.

                <p class="left-align light">At dusk they reached the Border. The woods in the Male Half stretched on the
                    other side. No living soul was to be noticed but Ayona and Kitasha knew only too well that the place
                    was teeming with spies ready to kill them. Men in the other Half could dream of nothing better than
                    the disappearance of the Female Half. Every single man out there kept his vigil for possible thieves
                    from the other Half.

                <p class="left-align light">They waited until it became very dark indeed and only then Ayona threw a
                    grain into the void. Suddenly a sheaf of variegated color lights sprang into life and made the two
                    girls protect their eyes. The lights formed a bridge which gradually became solid. It was lower than
                    the Border so that even if someone looked, they were not to be seen. The girls cautiously came down
                    to the bridge and ran along, crouching. They reached the other side safely, and went to sleep under
                    a tree.

                <p class="left-align light">In the morning, a distant clatter of horse hooves woke them. They had
                    sufficient time to come to and hide behind the trees. A stranger on horseback passed near without
                    seeing them. Ayona sent a silent word of thanks to the people who were farsighted enough to have let
                    her experience life in the slums so she could learn a lot of skills, among them the skill to be
                    still and not utter a sound until the danger was over. Why, had she wanted, she could have touched
                    this stranger, he passed so near. Obviously, he was some sort of a sentinel. Yet he went on his way
                    without noticing anything. The two brigand girls relaxed and continued on their way into the woods.
                    They walked West all day long and eventually reached Sinru late in the afternoon.

                <p class="left-align light">Sinru was the biggest town in the Male Half and also its capital. Men were
                    continually coming and going through its main gate. The girls were surprised to see so many men walk
                    around freely with no one to control them. Then they saw a female slave. She was sent to fetch water
                    and was desperately trying not to be in the way yet she crossed the path of a young man. He pushed
                    her aside rudely and cursed under his breath. Ayona made a furious movement and it was lucky Kitasha
                    was there to stop her. How dared a man treat a woman so! Of course, had the Princess herself shoved
                    a male slave on the street and cursed him, she would not have thought twice about it. But this was a
                    woman! Ayona expected the woman to dare the man and fight him on a duel. Instead, she got up and
                    hurried to the well. She then nearly ran back to town. The Princess was stunned. What was the matter
                    with this woman? Why did she not challenge him? How could such behavior be tolerated? She clenched
                    her teeth. There was something wrong in this Half! Women were not slaves, they were fighters! It was
                    men that were slaves! Or…?

                <p class="left-align light">While she was pondering on this, the sun set. Time for the most dangerous
                    part of their task.

                <p class="left-align light">The brigand girls stole to the back doors of the Palace. The latter was the
                    mirrored image of the Palace in their own Half so the Princess knew exactly where to go. Ritoh’s
                    statue was in the great hall right in the centre. They had to take the stone as quickly as possible
                    and disappear before the alarm was raised. It was not going to be easy, the place was full of guards
                    and the hall itself could have been a trap. Skillful as she was, Kitasha the seasoned thief tackled
                    the lock and they entered the Palace. They followed numerous curves and several times nearly bumped
                    into the guards. Finally they came near their goal. Now they had only to pass a very long corridor
                    which crossed with another, and there it was, their coveted goal. But there were no doors, or
                    niches, along this corridor, to take cover and they were to be exposed to the guards’ wary eyes. The
                    two friends took deep breaths and tiptoed to the door of the hall. They had covered nearly the whole
                    distance when their worst fears came true. The crossing corridor echoed with steps and pieces of
                    conversations. The girls looked at each other and pressed against the wall. They could only hope
                    that the men will pass by without as much as casting a glance in their direction. No such luck. The
                    guards had decided to wait for any potential thieves in front of the door instead of going on their
                    rounds all over the Palace and were now heading straight to the hall! When the first of them turned
                    round the corner, Ayona still hesitated as to what to do. For a split second all stood immobilized.
                    The men, because they were taken by surprise, and the women because they did not know what to do.
                    The Princess quickly counted the guards. Over twenty. However strong, she and her loyal girl friend
                    would not be capable of handling them.

                <p class="left-align light">"You go. I shall deal with them." Kitasha pushed her slightly to the door.

                <p class="left-align light">Ayona considered this, as she looked at her. Kitasha may be six foot ten,
                    yet even she could not fight over twenty men on her own. This was suicide all right. She opened her
                    mouth but Kitasha forced her to silence.

                <p class="left-align light">"Not a word! When, mind you, when and not if, you succeed in taking the Eye
                    of the Salyun, I shall be waiting for you here and we shall turn our backs to this rotten place at
                    once. Come on, go before they come to their senses. Thirty little boys are not a problem for me."

                <p class="left-align light">Ayona walked to the hall, while listening to her friend who was challenging
                    the guards using a vile language:

                <p class="left-align light">"In the name of Tavinga, what ugly bastards are you!"

                <p class="left-align light">Disgust had distorted her face and uttering a shout she slashed into the
                    crowd of males.

                <p class="left-align light">The Princess shook her head and stepped over the threshold. She had to
                    protect her eyes, so bright was the shine of the precious stone. Ayona looked around. Four ugly
                    figures surrounded the sculpture of the God. They were male torsos with heads of a snake, an insect,
                    a jackal and an owl, all in threatening postures. By the walls of the huge hall, which was round by
                    the way, there were numerous other statues, all copies of the four main figures. A bit taken aback,
                    Ayona took the Crystal Sword from her back where she had kept it till then, and approached the Eye
                    of the Salyun. She placed the Sword under the stone and briskly took the stone out of Ritoh’s mouth.
                    The stone resounded melodiously when it reached the floor, and stayed there as a piece of gold. The
                    girl looked around herself nervously. No poisoned arrows to kill her, no water to drown her.
                    Nothing. The Princess bent and took the gold piece. Nothing. She took a breath of relief. This sigh
                    seemed to be the sign the sculptures expected. Suddenly all figures in the hall came to life and
                    started moving towards her. Ayona realized then that the place was protected not by an ordinary trap
                    but by magic. She took off her weapon and steeled herself for a cruel battle. First she had to deal
                    with the four in the middle. The first blow decapitated the insect. The second pierced through the
                    heart of the jackal, the third ripped the belly of the snake open and the fourth bore the Sword so
                    deep into the owl’s head that Ayona had to struggle to withdraw it. While she was doing that she
                    noticed that the jackal and the snake had come to life again. So you had to strike mortal blows,
                    what with all those volunteers around you… Yet the weapon cut through these monsters much easier
                    than through people so she could save her energy. The girl brandished the Sword furiously trying to
                    make her way to the wall so that at least her back could be protected… She reached the wall and
                    started working rhythmically to butcher the creatures. She relied on her miraculous strength and her
                    tenacity. Yet the unknown magician had done his job extremely well and unless the creatures were
                    beheaded or cut into small pieces, they stayed neutralized only for a while. Ayona started feeling
                    discouraged. The number of creatures was decreasing but this was not enough. She could not endure
                    this long, not much longer. She forced herself to stop thinking and concentrate on striking. Strike,
                    lift the sword, strike next, lift the sword, strike again, lift, strike, lift, strike, lift… The
                    rhythm swallowed all her thoughts, only the will to live remained. To live, to survive even when
                    there was no hope, this is what Ayona had learned when she was still a toddler. Time lost its
                    meaning. She could not remember how long she had been fighting, and did not care. It could have been
                    an eternity- She was tired. The enemies were no longer that numerous, not more than ten were still
                    around. The Princess went on fighting even though the Sword felt heavier and heavier in her hand.
                    Finally, there were only three to fight. She managed to decapitate the first, and split the skull of
                    the second down to the nose. While she was trying to withdraw the Sword however, two hands closed
                    round her neck. She turned into the cold stare of the snake’s head. The grasp was growing stronger
                    and Ayona realized she was at the threshold of death. Suddenly the monster’s head split from its
                    body and its hands released their deadly embrace. Behind it stood Kitasha, blood-dripping sword in
                    her hand.

                <p class="left-align light">"Whassis, may I ask? I kept waiting and waiting and still no sign of you and
                    then I come in and see this thing here trying to throttle you and there is a slaughterhouse around.
                    Will you kindly explain whassis?"

                <p class="left-align light">"Later on, lets get away from here," Ayona croaked, massaging her throat.

                <p class="left-align light">The two friends made their way out of town with no one noticing or raising
                    the alarm. While walking to the Border, the Princess told Kitasha of her trial and wanted to know
                    what had happened meanwhile, outside the hall.

                <p class="left-align light">"Oh, there was a fine battle, there was, and I told you that some thirty
                    small boys can do nothing to me, I squashed them on the floor," the brigand girl said, obviously
                    very proud of herself.

                <p class="left-align light">They walked all day long. There were no salyuns in the Male Half but there
                    were grists. The grists were awful to look at, slimy and pimply all over but their meat was the
                    tastiest thing in the world. They reached the Border at night, used the second miraculous grain and
                    crossed undisturbed.

                <p class="left-align light">On the other side the earth was already rumbling, as the volcano was
                    activated. The girls felt safe and at home so they went to sleep near the void. In the morning they
                    got up rested and had almost forgotten their adventures from the previous night. They walked briskly
                    to Sakru, the capital of the Female Half where they lived, and were home on the same afternoon.
                    Before she brought the stone to the hall with Tavinga’s statue, Ayona went to see Sanaya.

                <p class="left-align light">The teacher was very happy.

                <p class="left-align light">"I am so glad to see you alive and well, my girl. So you have succeeded. Am
                    I right?"

                <p class="left-align light">"Of course, Sanaya. Did I prove to you that I was worthy to be the Chosen
                    One?"

                <p class="left-align light">"You did, Ayona. I did not mean to hurt you, I simply thought you a bit too
                    young for such a difficult task. Now, would you go and put the darned stone in its place, please, I
                    get seasick from the incessant earthquakes."

                <p class="left-align light">True, Sanaya did look changed. The Princess could not say exactly what was
                    the reason but was sure of the change. She pretended not to have noticed anything, and went and put
                    the Eye of the Salyun in its place. The earth shook once again and then froze. This was much better.
                    They would have nothing to fear for the next twenty years.

                <p class="left-align light">A new era started for Ayona. From now on she was to learn not to steal but
                    to protect the Half from thieves. Her method of training was very simple: she would start in the
                    morning with pockets full of money and if by nightfall all money was still with her, that would mean
                    she had done her job professionally. At the very beginning the girl would come home with barely a
                    couple of coins still left and feel really low. She knew how to steal but so did most of the women
                    in the city. Yet, gradually, she started to differentiate between the thief and the honest woman. In
                    a few years she knew how to recognize decent women with certainty. This was combined with endless
                    physical exercises. What happened in Sinru revealed to her that her stamina could still fail. While
                    she used to brandish her sword for four to five hours on end before, she was now capable of doing
                    this up to eight hours. A year before the ten-year period was over, Ayona was capable of
                    slaughtering enemies for ten hours on end. She doubted she could encounter enemies so numerous that
                    they could advance for ten hours and not be destroyed by her.

                <p class="left-align light">All these years Ayona was secretly keeping an eye on Sanaya. She was unable
                    to understand what had befallen her teacher. Surely many things were different. Before, Sanaya used
                    to pat her hair with her palm. Now this was gone. Formerly, she would have her favorite words and
                    phrases, she would grimace while talking. This was gone, too. She was not her old self. Ayona kept
                    watching, without asking as much as a question. She had patience and knew that the moment would come
                    when she would grasp the meaning of those changes.

                <p class="left-align light">There came the day when the sentinels on the Border announced that the
                    volcano had started shaking the Male Half. There were to follow five days in which the women would
                    either protect the stone to become the sole rulers of the Kingdom, or lose it to the males and have
                    to fight for their lives again, in another ten years. Simultaneously with this significant news
                    which made all women stand on their guard, the sentinels announced that a group of 15 to 20 women
                    slaves have succeeded in crossing the Border and were now heading to Sakru. Ayona felt bored. Again,
                    the newcomers had to be educated about the rules.

                <p class="left-align light">At dusk the refugees reached the gates of the city. The Princess with a few
                    of her court (including Kitasha, of course) were already expecting them. The new arrivals made a
                    variegated group. The youngest was a girl of about 13 and the oldest, a Granny of nearly 80, with a
                    walking stick. For a brief moment, Ayona wondered how they had ever succeeded in escaping but then
                    chased those thoughts away.

                <p class="left-align light">"Welcome to the Female Half," she started. "Since you have escaped from
                    those barbarians from beyond the Border you should feel very happy here."

                <p class="left-align light">"Well," said one of the women, "I wouldn’t call them barbarians…"

                <p class="left-align light">"In fact, they were not that bad," said another.

                <p class="left-align light">The Princess was looking at them in surprise. Every woman who had managed to
                    escape from under the control of men was telling horror stories of those animals who would not leave
                    you alone…

                <p class="left-align light">"Very well, I shall not ask you why you have escaped then if the situation
                    was not ‘that bad’," Ayona said when she recovered her ability to speak. "Yet I’d better inform you
                    that we have laws here. You are entitled to a three-day stay in the Palace until you find a place to
                    live. Then we shall throw you away. You can steal or lead a decent life - it is entirely up to you,
                    suit yourselves. But once you are outside this Palace, you would better not let me set my eyes on
                    you again unless you have risen so high in position as to be entitled to enter into the Palace. Any
                    questions?"

                <p class="left-align light">"One," said the old woman. "While we are staying in the Palace, would there
                    be any forbidden places or we could go anywhere we want?"

                <p class="left-align light">"There are no forbidden places," the Princess said calmly. "You are our
                    guests and can go wherever you want. Anything else?"

                <p class="left-align light">There were no other questions so they accommodated the women and left them.
                    Ayona and Kitasha stood guard in front of the door to the hall where the precious stone was kept.
                    Nothing whatsoever happened throughout the night and it was so quite that around five in the morning
                    both of them felt very sleepy. Ayona knew only too well that falling asleep could cost them the
                    magic stone. Yet no one had come so far, why should anyone want to come right now? Her eyes were
                    closing. She saw that her friend, too, was fighting sleep. After all, they could hardly be awake for
                    all four nights… They could afford five minutes…

                <p class="left-align light">Ayona woke up with a startle and saw her friend do just the same, just as
                    sleepy. The sunshine was streaming through the windows. So it was at least eight in the morning!
                    They must have slept for at least three hours! The two of them looked at each other frightened, and
                    reached for the door simultaneously. Two sighs of relief escaped their lips when they saw that the
                    Eye of the Salyun was in its place, untouched. They listened for a sound and realized what had
                    awaken them. Noise of steps and a strange thumping, echoed along the corridor, coming nearer. The
                    two girls prepared for a battle but released the grip on their weapons when they saw who was coming.
                    Round the corner the old lady from the Male Half appeared, thumping her stick, and made towards
                    them.

                <p class="left-align light">"I went out for a walk and your Palace struck me as rather empty and still,"
                    she said.

                <p class="left-align light">"In this period, I have in mind the five days for defense, only the guards
                    are here and they are trying to be absolutely noiseless," Ayona explained.

                <p class="left-align light">"I see. Might I perhaps have a look at the hall behind?" The old lady looked
                    beyond them. "I hear you have that precious stone here."

                <p class="left-align light">"By all means, you are well…" Ayona blinked. For a split second she thought
                    she saw something glistening, the stick looked metallic, rather than wooden. Nonsense, it was wood
                    all right. She shook her head. How was she to guard the stone when she had started to see things?
                    "Excuse me, I felt faint for a second. You are welcome."

                <p class="left-align light">"Oh, by the way, my name is Sabella. So as not to think of me as ‘That old
                    lady’," the woman said on entering the hall.

                <p class="left-align light">"But of course… No one thinks that…" The girls looked at one another,
                    ashamed.

                <p class="left-align light">"Not at all, I am not hurt. I am old, there is no denying." Sabella was
                    looking round herself with interest. "And who guards this treasure now? Is it magic?"

                <p class="left-align light">"No, it is only us and the numerous guards in the Palace," Kitasha
                    explained.

                <p class="left-align light">"Are you sure there is no magic? From what I have heard, you are lucky to
                    have a powerful magician in your Half, a woman called Sanaya."

                <p class="left-align light">"Yes, she makes magic but not in this case."

                <p class="left-align light">"Very beautiful hall, this. Well, I am off, the Palace is so big," the old
                    lady apologized and made for the door. "It was a pleasure. See you soon."

                <p class="left-align light">The Princess and her friend left, too and closed the doors behind
                    themselves. They had just assumed their guard when they heard someone running to them. This time it
                    was the 13-year old girl.

                <p class="left-align light">"Very pleased to meet you, I am Lirana," she shook Ayona’s hand and also
                    Kitasha’s hand. "Have you seen my Granny Sabella?"

                <p class="left-align light">"She has just left," Ayona said with a forced smile. The smile was forced
                    because she had felt the girl pressing a note into her palm. "I believe she went this way."

                <p class="left-align light">"Thanks a lot. I have been looking for her for the whole day. This is a huge
                    Palace." Lirana ran to the direction that Ayona had shown.

                <p class="left-align light">"Excuse me, Kitasha, do you think you could manage on your own for a while?
                    I have to go to the bathroom." The Princess smiled apologetically.

                <p class="left-align light">"Sure, though try not to stay away for too long. Who knows an horde of men
                    who have run amok and have destroyed everything on their way can materialize any moment to
                    annihilate us." Kitasha laughed at this thought. "Of course I shall manage. Try and get some sleep,"
                    she added, with concern.

                <p class="left-align light">"I shall follow your advice, don’t worry," Ayona answered and went in the
                    direction of Lirana.

                <p class="left-align light">When Kitasha could no more see her, Ayona opened the note.

                <p class="left-align light">"WE MUST TALK IN THE SLAVES’ ROOM ON THE UPPER FLOOR. IT IS IMPORTANT!!!
                    COME IMMEDIATELY!"

                <p class="left-align light">So far Sanaya had been the only person in the world to command Ayona. Yet
                    the Princess felt there was something that she had to understand. So she went up the spiral
                    staircase and entered the Slaves’ room. Lirana was already there, waiting for her.

                <p class="left-align light">"I shall ask you to listen to me attentively and not interrupt," the girl
                    began. The answer to this was a brief nod. "The men have a powerful magician among them. His name is
                    Harnig. Your teacher is not the real Sanaya. While you were busy stealing the stone, they kidnapped
                    her and replaced her with one of their inferiors. The group I came with also consists of men. No one
                    has ever learned about the magician because no one who knew has ever been left alive. The only
                    exception are the men enchanted by the spell and myself because I am the favorite in the Palace
                    there, and because they think I am too young to understand what is going on and threaten them. I
                    used to bring food and water to the real Sanaya. She is being forcibly kept in the Dungeon, the most
                    horrible place in the Kingdom. She can work magic from there, too, but it cannot match the magic of
                    Harnig. In the male group there was a boy on whom they had cast a spell to make him look like me.
                    Sanaya made him believe himself to be me and he now stays behind thinking and acting as Lirana while
                    I came over with the rest. I had to warn you. They are carrying the Bronze Axe with them, concealed
                    as the stick of Sabella. Yet your great magician has cast a spell over the hall where the Eye of the
                    Salyun is being kept so do not worry, though this has cost Sanaya her entire magic powers," Lirana
                    ended her story.

                <p class="left-align light">Ayona stood silent for a while, considering what she had just heard.

                <p class="left-align light">"So I have to kill my teacher and the refugees, is that what you mean? What
                    if they are innocent? What if you are under spell yourself? What if you are sent here to shed
                    innocent blood?"

                <p class="left-align light">Lirana stood and waited silently.

                <p class="left-align light">"No, too many things corroborate your story."

                <p class="left-align light">The girl smiled.

                <p class="left-align light">Suddenly a shout was heard from below and something heavy fell on the floor.

                <p class="left-align light">Ayona and Lirana ran down the stairs. When they reached the lower level they
                    saw Sabella entering the hall with her stick. Kitasha was prostrated, unconscious, on the floor,
                    blood running down her forehead. The Princess took her pulse and was relieved to feel it. She wanted
                    to follow Sabella but Lirana stopped her.

                <p class="left-align light">"Have trust in Sanaya, Your Highness. Do not go there. We shall enter when
                    everything is over."

                <p class="left-align light">Nothing happened for about a minute. Then the shrieks began. Ayona tried to
                    press her fingers onto her ears but they pierced her eardrums, shrieks of horrified people, going
                    through indescribable terror. The Princess was thankful to have been prevented from witnessing what
                    was going on there. In a while, silence reigned again.

                <p class="left-align light">"I can get in now," Ayona said but Lirana restrained her once again.

                <p class="left-align light">"The danger is still there. Someone may have survived, or the magic may
                    still be in action. Let me do that."

                <p class="left-align light">She entered the hall herself. A dying man’s shriek was heard.

                <p class="left-align light">"Yes, there was one survivor," Lirana remarked on her way out. "You can go
                    in now."

                <p class="left-align light">Ayona did go in. The first thing she noticed was that the stone was missing.
                    The second thing were the bodies of many men whose faces had frozen in the grimace of deadly fear.
                    The magic had obviously lost its grip after death. On the top of the pile of bodies there lied the
                    body of Lirana.

                <p class="left-align light">Quick steps in the corridor showed Ayona that Lirana’s killer was running
                    away. The Princess ran after him stopping on her way because she saw that Kitasha was coming to.
                    While the two of them were explaining the situation to one another, the killer had made great speed
                    and disappeared. The girls took the strongest horses and followed him. The man, too, had taken a
                    horse but had luckily bumped into one of the oldest and slowest in the stables so the girls came
                    near to him in less than half an hour. The magic was still in force so the girls were actually
                    watching the back of Lirana in front of them. Gradually, the distance was reduced so that Ayona was
                    able to shoot. She lifted up her bow. It was very difficult to make herself shoot the image of her
                    new friend. Apart from this, shooting anything on a galloping horse is not the easiest task in the
                    world. Yet Ayona’s endless training sessions were coming to use. The first arrow missed the man in a
                    girl’s image but the second scratched his hand and the third found its way to his heart. He fell
                    from his horse. When they reached him, the girls got off their horses and looked at him. On his back
                    was the Bronze Axe, in his palms the Eye of the Salyun.

                <p class="left-align light">"You know, it was very difficult to make myself shoot dead my new
                    girlfriend, who helped me so much," Ayona confessed. "I am awfully concerned about Sanaya. I intend
                    to go ahead and reach the Male Half and get her out of there safely. Will you help me?"

                <p class="left-align light">"You fail to realize that there is no use to ask me such elementary
                    questions," Kitasha grumbled. "Let’s go!"

                <p class="left-align light">Horses helped them shorten the way and they reached the Border in less than
                    two hours. They thought the horses would be able to jump over the void and Ayona’s horse did yet
                    Kitasha’s, being tired, slipped at the edge and nearly plunged her into the void. Luckily, the girl
                    managed to jump from his back before it disappeared there. Having escaped, Kitasha had to use
                    Ayona’s horse and that delayed them as one was walking while the other was on horse back.
                    Nonetheless, Sinru was reached before dusk. They left the horse in the woods and entered the city.
                    They imitated the slaves although not entirely successfully (Ayona was prepared to challenge a
                    passerby when he involuntarily pushed her aside). They asked a woman how to reach the Dungeon and
                    she told them yet she was watching them in a strange manner and eventually pronounced them crazy to
                    want to go there at all. They shrugged and followed her instructions. The first obstacle were the
                    guards at the door. The girls just could not kill them in front of so many people. Both being very
                    pretty, it was easy for them to lure the two men and make them come with them into an alley. There
                    the guards remained behind with their throats cut and the girls, getting into possession of their
                    keys, tried to remain unnoticed in unlocking the gates and getting inside.

                <p class="left-align light">It was very quiet and damp inside. Long stone steps were going down into the
                    darkness. Holding hands, the two friends descended. When the last vague light from under the gates
                    disappeared, they saw the pale flame of a distant torch. While they were descending, both felt
                    something light and soft touching their faces and hands. They thought it was cobwebs, yet could see
                    nothing. There was also a soft throbbing under their feet - could it be the awakening volcano? At
                    last they were down. The flickering light revealed a horrifying sight. The floor was plastered with
                    old and desiccated skeletons. Walls were more horrifying however. Numerous bodies, in various stages
                    of decay, were seen in shackles. There were also bodies in cages which hung from the ceiling. At the
                    beginning they could not see Sanaya. When they did see her, terror gave way to relief, she was alive
                    and though clad in rags, looked well enough. The girls rushed to embrace her. The three shed joyful
                    tears. The Princess told Sanaya of their tribulations and demanded to know what had happened to her
                    teacher.

                <p class="left-align light">"What Lirana told you is true. They kidnapped me and were holding me here.
                    But I tried to help you and obviously have succeeded. Let me tell you something about this Harnig.
                    He is not a magician. He is a creature from another world."

                <p class="left-align light">"HOW TRUE, DEAR SANAYA," the voice was coming from everywhere. Ayona and
                    Kitasha tried to discern its owner but there was no one and nothing to be seen. "DO NOT LOOK FOR ME,
                    MY DEARS, DON’T YOU REALIZE YOU ARE IN ME? SOME CALL ME THE DUNGEON, OTHERS CALL ME HARNIG BUT NO
                    ONE UNDERSTANDS WE ARE ONE AND THE SAME. ONLY YOUR SANAYA KNOWS AND WILL HAVE TO DIE. SHE IS SLY.
                    SHE USED MY MAGIC TO PROTECT YOU AND SUCCEEDED WHICH ANNOYS ME TREMENDOUSLY. I CAN TRANSMIT THOUGHTS
                    WHICH KILL BUT I AM MOST PLEASED WHEN SOMEONE IS DYING OF HUNGER AND THIRST, TO SEND HIM HIS MOST
                    AWFUL NIGHTMARE. I LIKED SANAYA IN A WAY THEREFORE SHE WAS GIVEN FOOD AND WATER BUT IT IS TIME NOW
                    FOR ALL OF YOU TO DIE."

                <p class="left-align light">"Did you feel some soft flying things upon entering? These are his secret
                    thoughts," Sanaya explained in whisper. "I have already figured out how to destroy him yet I cannot
                    break the damn shackles. Listen, try to catch one of the thoughts and bring it here, into the light
                    to show it to him, show him his own secret thought. Then rip it open with the sword and put the Eye
                    of the Salyun in there. If you do that and take it back to the entrance, he is done with. This
                    creature is the cause of all our trials and tribulations, he had made the two volcanoes and he keeps
                    them simmering. If you kill him, there will be no more need to enter the Male Half."

                <p class="left-align light">So they had to kill him. There was no other way to escape. They started
                    climbing back to the entrance.

                <p class="left-align light">"You silly, do you seriously think I am going to let you escape, you! I have
                    control over the gates, what do you think you will be doing there?"

                <p class="left-align light">Without paying attention, the two friends continued their way up until they
                    felt the flying soft things touch them again. They tried to catch at least one and realized how
                    great their speed was. In a while, tired already of waving her arms in vain in the void, Ayona heard
                    Kitasha’s voice:

                <p class="left-align light">"Princess, I caught one! I can barely feel it yet I am sure I am holding it.
                    Let’s go back!"

                <p class="left-align light">On their way down, Harnig’s shouts were heard again. They both held on to
                    his secret thought, lest it escaped at the very last moment.

                <p class="left-align light">"YOU ARE GOING TO GET ME VERY ANGRY INDEED, AND I AM GOING TO PUNISH YOU! DO
                    NOT MAKE ME KILL YOU! I WANT YOU TO PLEASE ME. WHAT IS THIS YOU ARE CARRYING? OH, NO!"

                <p class="left-align light">At this moment Kitasha took her head in her hands and started shouting:

                <p class="left-align light">"Take them away from me, take them away from me! For God’s sake, TAKE THEM
                    AWAY!!!"

                <p class="left-align light">Then the fit if it was a fit, passed and she held on to the thought even
                    more tenaciously. Now it was Ayona’s turn: she saw, in front of her, the most terrifying creature
                    she had ever faced in her life, worse than her nightmares. It defied description, it was slimy and
                    had sharp big teeth. It started coming up to her…

                <p class="left-align light">"Go away, please! DO NOT COME NEARER!"

                <p class="left-align light">The creature disappeared. Ayona realized she had let the thought go. Still
                    trembling, she succeeded in recatching it.

                <p class="left-align light">"Let’s finish quickly," the Princess implored. "He really means to kill us."

                <p class="left-align light">They were still standing on the last step. The moment their feet touched the
                    ‘carpet’ of skeletons, the strength of the phantoms diminished.

                <p class="left-align light">"A-A-A-A-A-A!!!"

                <p class="left-align light">They, too, read the thought now. This is what it said, in big block letters:

                <p class="left-align light">I COULD HAVE BEEN GOOD

                <p class="left-align light">Kitasha was holding the thought and Ayona took out the sword. With one quick
                    movement, she split the nothing into two. The letters scattered, and the thought remained empty. The
                    Princess took the magic stone out of her bosom and put it there. Another cry of pain shook the
                    dungeon. ‘This is for all the lives that have perished because of you!’ Ayona thought quickly and
                    ran back up the stairs. Sanaya’s words followed her:

                <p class="left-align light">"When you drop it, close your eyes and turn your back on it!"

                <p class="left-align light">The girl felt something flying past her. She had reached the spot. She threw
                    the thought up, turned her back on it and waited. Bright light poured and nearly blinded her even
                    though she had her back turned and her eyes protected with her hands on them. When the light went
                    out darkness looked impenetrable. Yet soon she discerned the flickering flame of the torch and went
                    down the steps.

                <p class="left-align light">"Did I really kill him?" Ayona was still uncertain in her victory.

                <p class="left-align light">"You did, my dear! Bravo, there could hardly be found another girl so
                    brave," the magician said. "Would you mind unlocking the damned shackles now and let’s get out of
                    the darned Half!"

                <p class="left-align light">The three of them climbed the stone staircase for the last time and went out
                    in the light of the setting sun and into the noise of the crowd. A last tremor shook the earth and
                    then everything was calm. ‘A deathbed tremor,’ Ayona thought.

                <p class="left-align light">The three women started on their journey back, spent the night together in a
                    wonderful mood, near to the Border, and reached their homes late on the other day. But, when they
                    got back, they discovered there was yet another problem to solve.

                <p class="left-align light">For, to live in the Kingdom meant you had to solve even more problems, and
                    the Magician, the Princess and the Thief belonged to the Kingdom to the bottom of their hearts.</p>
