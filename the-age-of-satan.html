                <p class="left-align">May 20, 2043, morning</p>

                <p class="left-align light">From the guide’s speech in the Museum of Archaeology:</p>

                <p class="left-align light">"And this, ladies and gentlemen, is the biggest mystery of all times. This
                    object here was found only recently, some ten years ago. It looks like a wristwatch, but actually it
                    is a message left for us. If you look closely, you’ll see the rough back surface. This is actually
                    writing, in contemporary world language, which can be read only under microscope. Here’s the
                    message:</p>

                <p class="left-align light">‘Beware of the power contained in this device. The Evil of our planet is
                    locked within. We know that you’ll be reasonable enough as a race (even though you’ll be so
                    different from us) and this is why we entrust to you with the role of Guardians of the Evil. The
                    Evil should be guarded with utmost care. If somebody puts this watch on his wrist, the Evil shall be
                    free and the Age of Satan will set in. Should you allow this to happen, your only chance shall be
                    the liquid in the small bottle you will find together with the device. The Evil should be sprinkled
                    with it while it’s second day at large has not run out or you’ll never be able to deal with it.
                    Humankind shall be erased from Earth.’</p>

                <p class="left-align light">"And, do you know what the strangest things about this wrist watch are?
                    First, all analyses show that it can be dated back some thirty thousand years before Christ. That
                    means that the creatures who left it here could see far ahead into the future. Second, the device
                    shows the time with perfect precision in all time-zones it is moved across. It moves an hour ahead
                    or back exactly when it is taken across the meridian. And it is hollow. There’s nothing inside this
                    box you see here. No mechanism, simple or complex, just nothing. Third, it is made of some unknown
                    metal. Scientists are positive that there’s no such metal on Earth. It’s a pity we lived in caves
                    when our planet was visited by creatures of higher intelligence. Some scientists think that indeed
                    there is something to this thing here, while others shrug it off, saying somebody is trying to find
                    out whether we are naive enough to waste our time on it. I personally am more inclined to believe
                    the latter, but that’s immaterial.</p>


                <p class="left-align">May 21, 2043, 4 PM</p>

                <p class="left-align light">"How kind of the guides to tell you all you need to make a good plan!"</p>

                <p class="left-align light">Ed Harris was a petty thief and had never thought of stealing anything
                    bigger than a lady’s purse. However, after his yesterday’s tour around the Archaeological Museum, he
                    was overwhelmed by desire for power. If he could only lay his hands on this "watch" or whatever it
                    was! He could then rule over the entire world! Of course, it might be that those extraterrestrial
                    palls had pulled a big joke and the inscription on the back was nothing but rubbish. But Ed believed
                    the massage was true. He hoped others believed, too, or otherwise everything was just a heap of
                    trash. Anyway, he could try. If he failed... well, he knew what life in the can looked like. He had
                    nothing to lose, so he decided to give it a try.</p>


                <p class="left-align">May 21, 2043, midnight</p>

                <p class="left-align light">The wire cut into the flesh of his throat at once. Jerry tried to scream, to
                    warn his partner, but in vain. It had to be admitted, the one who was trying to kill him, whoever he
                    was, knew his job well. After a few fruitless attempts to break free, the uniformed guard went numb.
                    He still felt the wire cutting through his flesh, severing muscles and tendons. The last thing he
                    was aware of, before departing on his last journey, was the relaxation of his vocal chords, when
                    this most easily handled and perhaps most deadly of the murder accessories went through them.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">Ed relieved his hold and gently lay the dead guard’s body on the floor. Now
                    he was playing in a higher class - he was now a murderer! And he had done wonderfully for a debut.
                    The man couldn’t make a sound before he died. Now the second guard remained. The thief propped the
                    dead body against the wall in order to gain some time. Then sneaked to the glass-case where the
                    "watch" was.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">Matthew smiled slightly. Jerry was again dozing off. He knew he had to wake
                    him and went closer to shake him up. He felt sorry for his partner. The man was working too much -
                    besides the night shifts in the museum, he also had a day job. Anyway, if the boss got wind Jerry
                    was sleeping when on duty, he’d fire him at once. Matthew tapped his shoulder expecting to startle
                    him as usual. This time however "napping" Jerry slid sideways and fell on the floor, revealing the
                    slit in his throat. Matthew stifled his scream. Jerry’s murderer was still around.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">"Who’s there? Show me your mug before I find you or you’ll come to grief!"
                    Matthew wasn’t all that sure he could do anything make his threat a good one. This was the first
                    corpse he had ever seen and he felt like going to the men’s room and throwing up everything he had
                    eaten during the day. But he was a guard. He had no right to do that.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">"All right, listen to me, buddy, unless you want to follow your friend
                    here." The voice seemed to come from all directions. Matthew looked around, scared. "Now you tell me
                    the magic code that opens this showcase and I leave you to live your miserable life to its natural
                    end, deal?"</p>

                <p class="left-align light">The last grain of courage left Matthew.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">"Please, don’t kill me! I’ll tell you all you want!"</p>

                <p class="left-align light">"Fine. I’m listening."</p>

                <p class="left-align light">"‘Evil’. The code is ‘evil’."</p>

                <p class="left-align light">"Good. Now let’s see if that’s true. If the alarm goes off you’re a dead
                    man, okay?" He paused. "Good boys never lie. Sleep tight!"</p>

                <p class="left-align light">A few seconds later Matthew joined his partner in the afterlife. The last
                    thing that crossed his mind was that one should never trust criminals.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">Ed Harris took the "watch" and disappeared into the unsuspecting night.</p>


                <p class="left-align">May 23, 2043, 1 PM</p>

                <p class="left-align light">"If you don’t give me these five million, he would be obsessed by Evil of
                    unknown proportions, don’t you understand?" Ed was trying hard to squeeze some profit out of his new
                    acquisition. Most people, however, were skeptical and did not mind to put the watch on. His plan was
                    gradually falling to pieces. The police had no idea who had killed the two guards and so far he was
                    getting away with it. He was sick and tired of failures and this time had decided to stick to his
                    threat. If they refused to pay him, this time he was definitely going to put the watch on this rich
                    bastard’s wrist, pretentious and phony as he was. He kept trying with the rich, because they never
                    called the police. Most of them had some dark secret they didn’t want advertised and preferred to
                    stay low. His theory had worked right so far - nobody had called the police. But no one was willing
                    to pay either. They didn’t seem to give a damn whether he put the lousy watch on their wrists or
                    not.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">Well, it was high time for this wretch to pay for the stupidity of the rest
                    of them. He had kidnapped nine people in the last two days, and had turned them free again, because
                    they had no intention to pay. They would have a good story of kidnapping to tell their
                    grandchildren, but Ed’s patience had run out.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">"Fine. Don’t tell me I didn’t warn you!" He switched off the purring
                    machine, which he called that because it purred like a cat. It was actually a device which could
                    control, by voice commands, what the other end of the line got on their communication screens -
                    picture, brightness, contrast, sound volume and quality, and so on. He could change his voice and
                    remove himself from the picture, while leaving the rest of the interior intact. Now he had done just
                    that and his voice was so scary, that he himself shuddered.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">Ed Harris went to his hostage, trying hard to look tough and dangerous. In
                    fact he was afraid nothing would come out of it. Overcoming his doubts and fears, he took his
                    victim’s hand and clicked the watch in place. The man’s name was Gary Trenton.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">"This watch is v-v-very n-n-ice," Gary began, but his words died down.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">Ed watched in horror the transformation the guy was undergoing. Under his
                    shirt, on his belly, two lumps began protruding, seemingly ready to burst out. His arms split along
                    their length with a disgusting swash! and suddenly he had four arms. Then his eyes began bubbling
                    and dividing into smaller globules until, finally, they looked like the eyes of an insect. The lumps
                    on his belly burst out of his shirt and two repugnant, snake-like tentacles, red and slimy, covered
                    with suckers, began slithering around. They had something like dark-bluish tripled tongues which
                    darted forward and back all of the time. The creature’s skin became poison green, fissures formed,
                    then the fissures became scales. The spikes growing on his back ripped through his clothes. His
                    mouth shrunk to a red spot and then thrust forth like a proboscis.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">"T-t-thanks," the creature said with an effort.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">So he could speak! Ed thought of what might happen if he caught this...
                    thing, and started showing him to people for money. A lot of money! Carried away by his dreams, he
                    hardly felt the slight pricking in his eye. A moment later he was wriggling on the floor in terrible
                    pain. The last five minutes of his life were an unbearable agony. When, at last, death came, he felt
                    relieved.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">"Thanks," the monster said, "for having released me."</p>

                <p class="left-align light">And freedom was sweet! After all this time in the detestable watch! He
                    lifted his foot and crushed the device in one single blow. Then he dispersed his molecules into the
                    air, mustering his strength for his fateful second day on this planet.</p>


                <p class="left-align">May 23, 2043, the five o’clock news</p>

                <p class="left-align light">"Millionaire Gary Trenton has reportedly disappeared today..." The face of a
                    fair-haired young man in his thirties appeared on the screen. Dark eyes, feminine features. His
                    height, weight and other distinctions were typed below. "If you have some information which could be
                    of help to establish his whereabouts, please call 245 169 875. Thank you. Earlier today, the dead
                    body of Mr. Ed Harris was found in his apartment on 62 Everest street. Mr. Harris had a criminal
                    record and had served several short term sentences for petty theft. Experts say that death has been
                    inflicted by some unknown, very powerful poison, causing almost instant, but also very painful
                    death. The poison was delivered by means of a small dart, which was found in the eye of the victim.
                    The examination of the last image recorded in his retina showed that the creature, which killed him,
                    looks like this..." A nightmarish monster with four arms, proboscis and tentacles protruding from
                    his belly appeared on the screen. "Some experts say that this is the beginning of the Age of Satan,
                    and that the creature is the Evil itself. They refer to the well-known extraterrestrial message
                    which was engraved on the "watch", recently stolen from the Archaeological Museum, which, as is
                    widely believed, have been delivered from outer space. Ambitious young scientist Diana Pierce has
                    undertaken to track down the monster and lock it up in another "watch", like the first one. That was
                    all in the TMTV news for tonight, ladies and gentlemen. Have a good evening."</p>

                <p class="left-align light">Mary switched off her TV-set in exasperation. What a crap! Somebody was
                    probably joking at the expense of the respectable citizens. She pressed the light switch. Nothing
                    happened. So something had, again, gone wrong with this stupid electricity. She felt a surge of
                    anger. She would have to have her supper in the dark again. The last 50 years hadn’t seen much
                    change that way. All the appliances kept misfunctioning as ever. She sat at the table. There was
                    something worrying in the darkness. She was aware of somebody’s presence. And after the hideous
                    monster she had seen on TV... She shuddered. Now she felt as if some unknown creature was lurking
                    behind each piece of furniture, in each dark corner. Then she stood up, deciding that she had
                    definitely seen the shape of something. But in this moment she felt pain in her eye. Impossible.
                    There could be no such thing! A heap of crap! Wild imagination, nothing more! She was tired and it
                    was playing tricks on her...</p>

                <p class="left-align light">She couldn’t finish her thought. The pain was enormous. A few minutes later
                    her soul departed her still convulsing body and set off to the world of which there is no
                    return.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">The creature stretched out his proboscis contentedly. The great battle was
                    to begin in a few hours. When this fateful second day was over, he, again, would be able to vanish
                    at his will. He had to conquer this planet. The only battle in which he had no right to disappear in
                    the usual way was still ahead. Those were the Rules of the Game. That was the reason why he used the
                    time until midnight to kill and then dissolve into thin air.</p>


                <p class="left-align">May 24, 2043, 2 AM</p>

                <p class="left-align light">Diana gestured to the pilot to circle over the block once more. She thought
                    she had seen something, down, to the south. Of course, she might have imagined it, but still she
                    wanted to be sure. She took pride in her eyesight. It couldn’t possible be a human being - it looked
                    green even in the faint moonlight. Besides... she thought she had seen spikes on its back. The pilot
                    made a vast turn and she saw the strange creature once more. This time she had no doubts whatsoever
                    - this was the Evil. She put on the latest model night-vision glasses. The world didn’t look
                    greenish through them as through the older models, but bright and well lit as it was in the
                    daylight. She turned to where the monster was, but didn’t see it. She lowered the glasses and looked
                    again. It was there. She looked again through the glasses. It disappeared. Lowered them. The
                    creature was definitely there. Something in the optical system prevented her from seeing it. Perhaps
                    the new substance they added to the glass. So she would have to cope with it without this aid, and
                    that would be much more difficult. She might miss the creature and the small bottle contained an
                    amount of liquid for no more than two attempts. If she failed humankind would be dead. A small
                    failure like that would be much too costly. She took a breath and nodded to the pilot. He lowered
                    the bird and almost brushed the monster’s head. Diana tried to pour some liquid on it. Just a
                    little, very little. But something disturbed the bird and that was enough for the liquid to miss the
                    monster by more than a yard. The creature heard the splash and started. Then it went to sniff the
                    small puddle. The smell seemed to be familiar, because the monster darted in the opposite direction
                    at full speed. The bird doubled back and followed. When they were close enough and Diana was getting
                    ready for her second attempt, the monster turned back and hit the bird in the eye. The bird winced
                    from the pain and changed her direction. Diana sat back, feeling nothing. She had failed. She had
                    doomed her fellow human beings to death. She was about to throw away the bottle and the new watch,
                    when she noticed that there were still a few drops inside. There was still some hope. The bird was
                    rapidly losing altitude. The convulsions would begin any moment now. She had a moment, perhaps two,
                    to act. The monster had stopped and watched them, obviously glad to have neutralized them. Now!
                    Diana poured the last droplets, but... nothing happened. She had failed again! No, there was no hope
                    for her or humanity. The bird began wriggling and the two of them, the woman and the pilot, fell off
                    her back. Diana remained prostrate, as she had fallen, until she heard some moaning. She turned to
                    look at the creature. A part of it had already disappeared, the rest was dissolving quickly, as if
                    erased by a giant rubber. Only a small heap of dust-like substance remained in the end. Diana
                    nervously swept the dust into the watch and didn’t stop until she was sure to have removed the last
                    speck from the hideous monster. Then, at last, she sighed in relief. The nightmare was over.</p>

                <p class="left-align light">The place was somewhat narrow. But it was always like that. Anyway. He’d
                    have to wait. There were lots of other greedy people on this planet. Besides, it didn’t have to be
                    this planet. Somewhere in the Universe there certainly was a planet where they wouldn’t be able to
                    stop him. Then... the Age of Satan would at last begin.</p>
